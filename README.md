# Swaying Wheat Animation on ESP32
This project simulates the gentle swaying motion of three wheat stalks using an ESP32 board and the TFT_eSPI library. Inspired by peaceful countryside memories from fall in China, the project captures the essence of wheat swaying in the wind, bringing a nostalgic scene to life.



## Supplies
- ESP32 Board
- Arduino IDE
- TFT_eSPI Library

## Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Upload the Code**:  
   Upload the code from `sketch_ear_of_wheats.ino` to your ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE.

2. **Install the Library**:  
   Make sure the [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) library is installed in your Arduino IDE. You can install it via the Library Manager by searching for "TFT_eSPI."

3. **Connect the Hardware**:  
   Connect your TFT screen to the ESP32.

4. **Run the Project**:  
   Once the code is uploaded, the project will display three wheat stalks swaying left and right across the screen, simulating the gentle movement of wheat in the wind.
